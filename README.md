## Featured Projects

### 1. Stock Monitoring System
Multi-website monitoring system tracking 30+ sites (mostly Norwegian) for various products including sneakers, PS5, and clothing items. Mostly built using web scraping and API integration.

### 2. PS5 Stock Tracker
My first proper programming project - a web scraper designed to monitor PS5 stock availability in real-time.

### 3. [Raspberry Pi SmartHub](https://github.com/C-a-p-a/rpi-smarthub)
Combining hardware and software in one project - A smart hub designed to give me useful information at a glance. Weather forecast, bus departures, live stock prices, calendar, today's headlines, shopping list++. Ran on a Raspberry Pi 5 with a 7' touch screen.

### 4. [Pokemon Battle](https://github.com/C-a-p-a/Pokemon-Battle)
Project I developed in the course "Introduction to Object Oriented Programming" at UiB. The purpose of this project was to learn more about Object Oriented Programming (OOP), testing (JUnit 5, Pit) and write good, modular code.

### 5. [Wordle AI Solver](https://github.com/C-a-p-a/Wordle-AI-Solver)
Built for the "Algorithms and Data Structures" course at UiB. Multiple AI strategies with varying performance - custom strategy significantly outperforms baseline through smart exploration-exploitation balancing. Focus on algorithm optimization and runtime complexity analysis.
